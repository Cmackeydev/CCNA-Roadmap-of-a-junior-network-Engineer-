I am about to start with yhe IPV6 chapter in the book. IPV6 being a dense subject i want to first finish a DHCP/DNS lab that i started. The issue is that i am doing the lab and gns3 and i need a dns server. The solution that i had thought about is this one :  Using a debian package on a virtual machine . The Virtual machnes that i nstalled on gns3 doesn't come with any package that can act as a dns server so i need to dwonload it , but i cannot connect my topology to access real nternet via wireless card and i dont have acces (or rather i dont know) to a wired network whch have access to Internet. So i must find a wat to modify the qcow2 via qemu (Installing the package on qemu) so that when i use it on gns3 it has a package installed that can act as a dns server. So this s what im working on. I planned to put a screenshot of the topology of the lab  planned to do when  do it.
