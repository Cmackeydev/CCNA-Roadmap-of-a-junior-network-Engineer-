## Why this repository ?

Hey all this repository is an attempt not only to prepare my ccna exam as a Junior Network Engineer but also sort of a roadmap that will be constructed "sur le tas" for any other junior network engineer who would like to take their CCNA Exam.

## Some context

I am a Haïtian junior network Engineer , working in a telecom company (we will call it the COMPANY for NDA purposes). I am almost done with my College degree (Public Hatïan University system is complicated which explain why we often starting by working before havng our degree...). As today of December 24<sup>th</sup> , i have been working for COMPANY for about 6 months now and i am working with Distributions routers mainly. I am not responsible of big complicated confgurations on theses routers (for now ihope ...). As a network engineer i want to be an *expert* and to *master* my field of work. This task is easiest said than done. The first step is obviously to take the CCNA certifications exams. So i intend to pass it in February 2025 (Perhaps CCNP not so long after , yeah i know i migh sound crazy or and a hurry). So the context explain now we can continue.

## My background

I am some kind of a *nerd* , i am using computers since a *young* age about 10  (relatively for a poor country like Haïti), this leds me to programming and choosing and Electrial and Engineering Domain for my degree. I was too orentied networking before startng my degree but i already has a good grasps with the core networking concepts. I had some kind of introductory class to Networks in my last two years of college which greatly influenced (along the fact that im working as a network engineer) my decision to pass the CCNA exam.

## Deadline

I want to pass my exam in February 2025. This lets me about two months to prepare. I already started about 3 weeks of preparations before created this repository. I will list all the materials i have already covered before starting this repository in the upcoming sections.

## Objectives

1. Preparing the CCNA v1.1 exams
2. Learning as much as possible as an Network engineer
3. Doing it in a 2 months due date

## Ressources used

Here is a list of the ressources i am using for my preparations.

1. CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide Volume 1 and 2 (2020 version)
2. [Jeremy's IT LAB](https://youtu.be/H8W9oMNSuwo?si=wC_gCLNB39r9dfg3) — CCNA Preparation Playlist
3. Cisco Packet Tracer
4. The [Boson](https://boson.com) Package for CCNA preparation (includes the Network Simulator, course, and exams)
5. GNS3
6. Google

## The work done so far

As of december 26<sup>th</sup> the work done so far is

1. I have completed the Tutoral of Jeremy's IT LAB. i have try to redo like 80% of the lab he did in Packet Tracer.
2. I have read 1700 pages on a total of 3035 pages of the First Volume of the CCNA 200-301 books. I have an electronic version the actual quantity of pages may vary.
3. I have done a lot of labs in Packet Tracer which i have imagined myself.
4. I have done some labs in GNS3 which o have imagined myself.
5. My usual tasks invlolving router at work

## Approach of this preparation / repository

I have already follow the Jeremy's IT LAB playlist more or less , now the goal is to finish all the two volumes of the books , taking notes and donf extra research on the internet and i plan to also do all the Boson labs. The order i plan to do the Boson labsis not rigid , i will not do them after completely finishng to read the books but rather i will do them along the way because there is a lot of concepts that i actually have a good grasp on them. I will divide the repository in Folders corresponding to each points listed of the official CCNA v1.1 guide determined by CISCO. I will try to kept my progress in chronological order in each parts as a lots of the preparation materials doesn't do each part sequentially , i'll do my best to present it really in a chronological ordrer as one of the main goals of this repository is to show you a path (not necessarly *the one* ) for your preparation of the CCNA exams.

For each parts i will write a markdown retrieving the important concepts to retain for the exams (some notes) as interesting facts that i learned and also explanations. Whenever possible i will share lab files with Gns3 and packet tracer , although that i this point i doubt that i will do packet tracer labs anymore (I find packet tracer a little too much restrictive). I will also share a lot of Topology pictures since i wont be able to share all the lab files (I dont think that i could share the boson files) .Also note that as i am a junior network engineer i will try to go further the simple concepts required to pas the CCNA. I will try to go a little deeper for strong knowledge for my upcoming carrer in IT.

## Lets start

So buckle up your seatbelts , we are going for the ride. I will of course share with you my final impressions of this run and also my result with the exam.
