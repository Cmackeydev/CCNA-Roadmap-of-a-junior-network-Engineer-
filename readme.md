## Why this repository ?

Hey all this repository is an attempt not only to prepare my ccna exam as a Junior Network Engineer but also sort of a roadmap that will be constructed "sur le tas" for any other junior network engineer who would like to take their CCNA Exam.

## Some context

I am a Haïtian junior network Engineer , working in a telecom company (we will call it the COMPANY for NDA purposes). I am almost done with my College degree (Public Hatïan University system is complicated which explain why we often starting by working before havng our degree...). As today of 24th December , i have been working for COMPANY for about 6 months now and i am working with Distributions routers mainly. I am not responsible of big complicated confgurations on theses routers (for now ihope ...). As a network engineer i want to be an *expert* and to *master* my field of work. This task is easiest said than done. The first step is obviously to take the CCNA certifications exams. So i intend to pass it in February 2025 (Perhaps CCNP not so long after , yeah i know i migh sound crazy or and a hurry). So the context explain now we can continue.

## My background

I am some kind of a *nerd* , i am using computers since a *young* age about 10  (relatively for a poor country like Haïti), this leds me to programming and choosing and Electrial and Engineering Domain for my degree. I was too orentied networking before startng my degree but i already has a good grasps with the core networking concepts. I had some kind of introductory class to Networks in my last two years of college which greatly influenced (along the fact that im working as a network engineer) my decision to pass the CCNA exam.

## Deadline

I want to pass my exam in February 2025. This lets me about two months to prepare. I already started about 3 weeks of preparations before created this repository. I will list all the materials i have already covered before starting this repository in the upcoming sections.

## Objectives

    1. Preparing the CCNA v1.1 exams
    2. Learning as much as possible as an Network engineer
    3. Doing it in a 2 months due date
